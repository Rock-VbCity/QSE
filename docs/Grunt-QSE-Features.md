Now that we generated our first <i>Grunt QlikSense Extension</i> let's explore its features, we will do that by adding our new extension to an empty <i>Sheet</i> in QlikSense Desktop!

The <b>Grunt QS Extension template</b> implements all known properties organized in Sections; these properties are placeholders for you to use; you should keep the properties your extension requires and comment-out or delete those that are not required.

We will not indulge in explaining each property in this document.
