# <img src="images/grunt-03.png" width="60px"> Grunt prerequisites
Grunt is a popular *JavaScript Task Runner* which is included with the *QlikSense Extension Template*; its function is to build and rebuild the extension based on the supplied Gruntfile.

We also included some Grunt tasks you may want to use when building your QlikSense extension, specially when preparing its code for distribution in GitHub.

# Getting started

These are the modules required by Grunt:
 
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/ "nodejs"); Node install the Node Package Manager, e.g. npm
<li> [grunt-cli](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started); this link contains the grunt getting started guide)
<li> [grunt-init](https://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding); this is the grunt's projects scalfolding module
</ul>

### GitHub

We do not need GitHub installed for Grunt to work but one of the benefits of installing this Grunt based QSE Template is to enable deploying your QlikSense extension into your GitHub repositories.
