# QSE QlikSense Extensions Scaffolding

This is a Grunt-Init project scaffolding to automate the creation of QlikSense Extensions environments; you should run the script in the extension's folder.

## Prerequisites

grunt-cli
grunt-init

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding "grunt-init").

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-gruntfile.git ~/.grunt-init/QSE
```
## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init gruntfile
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
